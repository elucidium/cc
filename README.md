# (trying to write a) C compiler

Once I have some extra time (i.e. I'm not taking online classes and doing an internship at the same time), I'll be attempting to write a C compiler following the steps in [this writeup](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html). I'm just making this repository now in order to hold myself accountable to this project.
